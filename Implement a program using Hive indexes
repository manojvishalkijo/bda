1. Creating an Index
Creating an index means creating a pointer on a particular column of a table. Its syntax is as
follows:
CREATE INDEX index_name
ON TABLE base_table_name (col_name, ...) AS 'index.handler.class.name'
[WITH DEFERRED REBUILD]
[IDXPROPERTIES (property_name=property_value, ...)] [IN TABLE index_table_name]
[PARTITIONED BY (col_name, ...)] [
[ ROW FORMAT ...] STORED AS ...
| STORED BY ...
]
[LOCATION hdfs_path] [TBLPROPERTIES (...)]
Example
Use the same employee table that we have used earlier with the fields Id, Name, Salary,
Designation, and Dept. Create an index named index_salary on the salary column of the
employee table.
The following query creates an index:
hive> CREATE INDEX inedx_salary ON TABLE employee(salary) AS
'org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.index.compact.CompactIndexHandler';
2. Dropping an Index
The following syntax is used to drop an index: DROP INDEX <index_name> ON
<table_name>
The following query drops an index named index_salary: hive> DROP INDEX index_salary
ON employee;
The following query drops a view named as emp_30000: hive> DROP VIEW emp_30000;
